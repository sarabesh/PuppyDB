# PuppyDB 🐶

**PuppyDB** is a playful vector database built from scratch with:

- **Flat files + mmap** for fast vector storage
- **RocksDB** for metadata and offsets
- **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs) for approximate nearest neighbor search
- A simple WAL for durability

Fetch your vectors fast — just like a good puppy! 🐾

### Project Status

🚧 **In Progress**  
This is an experimental learning project to explore how vector databases work under the hood.  
Major components are being built step by step.

---

### Planned Features

- Insert vectors with metadata
- Perform top-k nearest neighbor search
- Persistent vector and metadata storage
- Lightweight and fun to use

---

### Project Goals

- Learn the internals of building a vector DB
- Explore custom HNSW implementation
- Keep the architecture simple and hackable
